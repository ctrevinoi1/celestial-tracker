## üî¥ Critical Missing Features

### 1. **Mount Alignment Verification**
**Issue**: System doesn't verify if mount is aligned before tracking
```python
# MISSING: Check alignment status before operations
mount_status = await ws_client.get_mount_status()
if not mount_status.get("IsAligned", False):
    # Should trigger alignment or abort
    logger.error("Mount not aligned!")
```
**Solution**: Add alignment check in main() before tracking begins

### 2. **Focus Control**
**Issue**: No automatic focus adjustment
```python
# API Available but NOT USED:
# Focuser.GetStatus
# Focuser.GotoPosition
# Focuser.RunAutoFocus
```
**Solution**: Implement auto-focus before observation session

### 3. **Plate Solving Integration**
**Issue**: No verification of actual pointing vs. commanded position
```python
# API Available but NOT USED:
# TaskController.RunPlateSolve
# Could verify telescope is actually pointing where expected
```
**Solution**: Add periodic plate solving to verify/correct pointing

## üü° Important Missing Features

### 1. **Live Stream Preview**
**Current**: No visual feedback during tracking
```python
# API Available but NOT USED:
# LiveStream.GetDisabledLiveStream
# LiveStream.SetDisableLiveStream
# LiveStream.SetEnableManual
```
**Enhancement**: Enable live view for operator monitoring

### 2. **Advanced Camera Settings**
**Current**: Fixed camera parameters
```python
# API Available but NOT USED:
# Camera.GetCameraInfo - for dynamic limits
# ColorBBalance, ColorGBalance, ColorRBalance - for color tuning
# Offset - for background level adjustment
```
**Enhancement**: Dynamic parameter adjustment based on conditions

### 3. **Weather Integration**
**Current**: No weather awareness
```python
# Partially Used:
# Environment.GetStatus - only for health check
# Should monitor continuously for:
# - Humidity approaching dew point
# - Temperature changes affecting focus
```
**Enhancement**: Continuous environmental monitoring

### 4. **Dew Heater Management**
**Current**: No active dew prevention
```python
# API Available but NOT USED actively:
# DewHeater.SetMode
# DewHeater.SetHeaterLevel
```
**Enhancement**: Automatic dew heater control based on conditions

## üü¢ Optimization Opportunities

### 1. **Improved Tracking Algorithm**
**Current Issue**: 1-second discrete steps may cause jerky motion
```python
# Current implementation:
for point in trajectory:
    await ws_client.goto_alt_azm(point['el_rad_celestron'], 
                                  point['az_rad_celestron'])
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
```
**Improvement**: Use Mount.Slew for continuous motion
```python
# Better approach:
# Calculate velocity vectors
# Use Mount.Slew with appropriate rates
# Smoother tracking for fast satellites
```

### 2. **Parallel Image Processing**
**Current Issue**: Sequential download after pass completion
```python
# Current:
results = await asyncio.gather(*image_download_tasks)
```
**Improvement**: Start downloads during tracking
```python
# Better:
# Download images as they're captured
# Process while tracking continues
```

### 3. **Smart Pass Selection**
**Current**: Takes all visible passes
**Improvement**: Implement priority scoring:
- Satellite brightness/magnitude
- Maximum elevation
- Pass duration
- Weather conditions
- Previous success rate

### 4. **Error Recovery**
**Current**: Basic error logging
**Improvement**: Implement recovery strategies:
```python
# Add retry logic for:
# - Failed slews
# - Image capture failures
# - Connection drops during passes
```

## üìä Performance Enhancements

### 1. **Mount Acceleration Profiles**
```python
# Use Mount.SetMountConfig for optimized motion:
await ws_client.send_command("Mount", "SetMountConfig", {
    "AltBacklash": 0,  # Reduce backlash
    "AzmBacklash": 0,
    "CustomRate9Speed": optimal_rate,  # For satellite speeds
    "EnableCustomRate9": True
})
```

### 2. **Predictive Positioning**
```python
# Instead of reactive tracking:
# Calculate future position considering:
# - Mount response time
# - Network latency
# - Command processing delay
future_time = current_time + SYSTEM_DELAY
future_position = calculate_position(satellite, future_time)
```

### 3. **Batch Command Optimization**
```python
# Current: Individual commands
# Better: Batch related commands
commands = [
    ("Camera", "SetCaptureParameters", params),
    ("Mount", "GotoAltAzm", position),
    ("TaskController", "RunSampleCapture", capture_params)
]
# Send as transaction if API supports
```

import pytest

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_coordinate_conversion():
    # Test Alt/Az to radians conversion
    # Test trajectory calculation accuracy
    # Test time window calculations
```

### 4. **Logging Enhancement**

            satellite=satname,
            norad_id=norad_id,
            duration_seconds=duration,
