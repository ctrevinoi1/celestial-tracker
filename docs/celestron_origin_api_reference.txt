Description

This document defines the command and response system of the Origin architecture. This document is still under active development. New commands will be added or removed as necessary.
The system is based around a JSON based messaging via WebSockets. Each message

contains	,

,	,	, and

. See

CommandHeaders. Messages may contain extra feilds as needed. For example, to set capture

parameters

and

, the message could be:



Some fields are optional. In this document, optional types have a "?" suffix. For example, in

Camera.SetCaptureParameters, the

field has the type

, meaning the

field is optional, and the ISO capture parameter is only set if the field is included in the message payload.

It is the responsibility of the sender set the	to something meaniful to the sender.


Every response contains

, and

. See ResponseHeaders. Every

message will be responded to with a message containing the inversed

/	, and the same

and

. For example, to check if

the live stream is disabled, the command would be:

Origin would then respond with:

LocationType
Describes a particular object or target location to be imaged, both as a single target (for the TaskController.RunImaging command) and for multiple targets (in the TaskController.RunObservingList command).
Properties

Name	Type	DescriptionUuidstringUnique ID for this object or target location.

Ra

doubleright ascension coordinate of target to slew to before imaging, J2000, radians. If absent, telescope will not slew and imaging will begin at current RA/Dec coordinates.

Dec

doubledeclination coordinate of target to slew to before imaging, J2000, radians. If absent, telescope will not slew and imaging will begin at current RA/Dec coordinates.
MinimumStartTime
string?Minimum time before imaging should begin, Format: DD MM YYYY hh:mm:ss where hh is a 24hr clock. Assumed to be in local time zone.

TotalDuration

doubleTotal duration in seconds to stack and image. If not present, then imaging will run until TaskController.CancelImaging or HaltTasks is received, until stacking fails, or 12 hours have elapsed.
SaveRawImage
boolean?If TRUE, all raw images will be saved on the raspberry pi's local SD card storage.ObjectSizedouble?Apparent size of the target object in radians.
ObjectMagnitude
double?Visual magnitude (brightness) of the target object



Name


string?Name of the target object to be imaged. If absent, a default name will be formed from the target RA/Dec coordinates. The directory where raws and FinalStackedMaster images for this target are saved on the raspberry pi, is constructed from this name, and the imaging start time.


ExposureTime


double?Individual raw frames should use this particular exposure time in seconds. (As opposed to TotalDuration, which is the desired total duration of the entire stacked image, so number of individual frames combined to form the FinalStackedMaster should be TotalDuration / ExposureTime.)

ISO

ISOValueEnum?Allowed values for camera's light sensitivity, i.e. gain, from least to most light-sensitive. ISO 100 roughly corresponds to gain 10 dB, ISO 200 to 20 dB, and ISO 2000 to 40 dB. Treat these values with caution.
